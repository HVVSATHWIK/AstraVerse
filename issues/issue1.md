# Notification panel appears in background when clicked

**Labels**: Bug

**Description**: The notification panel is appearing in the background when clicked instead of properly displaying in the foreground. This makes it difficult for users to interact with notifications.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Click on notification bell icon
2. Observe that panel appears behind other UI elements
3. Panel is not accessible for user interaction.

**Expected behavior**: Notification panel should appear in the foreground with proper z-index layering.
