# Core Functionalities

AstraAI is built for developers, teams, and hackathon builders who want to integrate AI automation into real-world workflows without complex setup.

## 1. Workflow Management
AstraAI empowers users to design, deploy, and manage AI-powered workflows with an intuitive visual builder. Key aspects include:
- **Trigger-Based Automation**: Set up workflows triggered by events like email receipts, app integrations, or scheduled times.
- **AI Integration**: Embed AI models (e.g., Google Gemini) into workflow steps for tasks such as content generation, data analysis, or decision-making.
- **Conditional Logic**: Add branching and conditions to create dynamic workflows that adapt to real-time data.
- **Templates and Modes**: Use pre-built templates for quick setup or switch to advanced mode for complex customizations.
- **Monitoring and Optimization**: Track workflow performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize for better efficiency.

*Example: Auto-generate meeting minutes after every Zoom call.*

## 2. Agent Management
Manage a fleet of AI agents specialized for different tasks, ensuring optimal performance and oversight:
- **Agent Creation and Configuration**: Define agents for specific roles, such as data processing, customer support, or content creation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: View agent status, performance metrics (e.g., response time, success rate), and activity logs.
- **Scalability**: Deploy multiple agents to handle high-volume tasks without compromising speed.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in mechanisms to detect and resolve agent failures, with alerts for manual intervention if needed.

*Example: An agent specialized in creating Jira tickets from meeting summaries.*

## 3. Integrations Hub
Connect AstraAI to a wide range of external services and applications for seamless data flow and automation:
- **Supported Platforms**: Integrate with popular tools including Zoom (for meeting automation), Slack (for communication), Jira (for project management), MongoDB (for databases), InfluxDB (for time-series data), and Milvus (for vector databases).
- **No-Code Setup**: Easily configure integrations without writing code, using AstraAI's drag-and-drop interface.
- **Data Synchronization**: Ensure real-time data exchange between connected apps, enabling automated workflows across ecosystems.
- **Security and Compliance**: All integrations adhere to enterprise security standards, with encryption and access controls.

*Example: Slack channel updates after Jira ticket creation.*

## 4. Analytics & Monitoring
Gain deep insights into your AI operations with comprehensive analytics and real-time monitoring:
- **KPI Dashboards**: Track key metrics like meeting reduction, task completion rates, response latency, and system health.
- **Performance Analytics**: Monitor AI engine usage, workflow efficiency, and resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory).
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive notifications for anomalies, such as high latency or failed integrations.
- **Predictive Insights**: Use AI-driven analytics to forecast trends and recommend optimizations.

*Example: Dashboard showing AI response times and workflow success rates.*

## 5. AI Capabilities
Leverage state-of-the-art AI models to enhance productivity and automate complex tasks:
- **Google Gemini Integration**: Utilize Gemini for content generation, data analysis, document processing, and more.
- **Meeting Automation**: Transcribe meetings, generate summaries, extract action items, and create follow-up tasks automatically.
- **Content and Data Processing**: Analyze documents, generate reports, and provide sentiment analysis or entity recognition.
- **Interactive Playground**: Test AI prompts and templates in a sandbox environment to refine outputs before deployment.

*Example: Gemini-powered sentiment analysis on customer feedback.*

## 6. User Management
AstraAI includes robust user authentication and profile management features:
- **Authentication**: Secure sign-up, sign-in, and password reset processes powered by Supabase.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update personal information, manage permissions, and access activity logs.
- **Role-Based Access**: Assign roles (e.g., admin, user) to control access to sensitive features and data.
- **Activity Tracking**: Log user actions for auditing and personalized recommendations.

*Example: Role-based access for team admins to manage integrations.*

## 7. Pilot Mode
Explore experimental features and early-access capabilities in a dedicated section:
- **Beta Features**: Test new AI models, integrations, or workflow enhancements before full release.
- **Feedback Loop**: Provide input on pilot features to influence product development.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Isolated environment to prevent experimental changes from affecting production workflows.

*Example: Testing a new AI model for document summarization without impacting live workflows.*
